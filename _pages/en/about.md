We work on foundational aspects of quantum information theory, aiming to understand operational significance of quantum properties using the tools in physics, information theory, and computer sciences. 
We are generally interested in wide range of topics in quantum information, but we have been paricularly focusing on 

- Quantum resource theories

- Quantum entanglement theory

- Quantum thermodynamics

- Continuous-variable qunatum information

- Quantum error correction and mitigation

- Quantum algorithms
