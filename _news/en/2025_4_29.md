[Our work](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.170201) (by Ryuji) on quantum thermodynamics has been published in Physical Review Letters. We showed that "Gibbs-preserving operations"---one of the standard operations frequently used in anslysis---may require infinite cost to implement, encouraging us to reconsider physical justification of its use. Joint work with Hiroyasu Tajima at Kyushu University.
