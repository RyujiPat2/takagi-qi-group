Our work on quantum thermodynamics has been published in [Physical Review Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.170201). We showed that "Gibbs-preserving operations"---one of the standard operations frequently used in anslysis---may incur infinite costs to implement, prompting us to reconsider the physical justification of their use. Joint work with Hiroyasu Tajima at Kyushu University.
